# X-Ray.Content — C# / .NET 10 Port

Part of the **X-Ray** family of .NET libraries; this is its content-extraction package.

This repository contains a **native C# port** of the content-extraction engine from the
Rust [`xberg`](.reference/crates/xberg) crate. It is *not* a wrapper around the Rust library or its
NuGet package — every extractor, type, and renderer is reimplemented in managed C#, shipped
as the `X-Ray.Content` NuGet package, whose API lives in the `XRay.Content` namespace (a NuGet id may carry
a hyphen; a C# identifier may not).

The repository also holds `X-Ray`, the family's umbrella package — no code, just a dependency on
every X-Ray package. See [`X-Ray` — the family's root package](#x-ray--the-familys-root-package).

The original Rust sources under [`.reference/`](.reference) are left untouched so that upstream
Rust work can be merged and the C# port re-synchronized.

---

## Scope

**In scope — content extraction only:**

- All supported document/file formats (Office first, then the rest).
- All original *output formats*: plain text, Markdown, HTML, and the structured
  object model / JSON tree.
- Metadata, tables, images (bytes + references), URIs, per-page content.

**Out of scope (explicitly excluded):**

- Audio/video transcription.
- Embeddings, GLiNER/NER, LLM/structured-extraction, reranking.
- Server mode (REST API, MCP), chunking-for-RAG, keyword extraction.
- Code intelligence (tree-sitter, 306 languages) — **low priority**, only after
  every other format is ported and validated.

When a Rust code path branches into an excluded feature, the C# port takes the
"native extraction only" branch and drops the excluded one.

**OCR is the one exception, and a deliberate deviation from upstream** rather than a
port of it — off by default, opt-in, and a different engine. See
[Deviation: optional OCR](#deviation-optional-ocr). A second, much smaller deviation
renders a spreadsheet's cells the way the spreadsheet shows them — see
[Deviation: formatted Excel cells](#deviation-formatted-excel-cells).

## Architecture (mirrors the Rust crate)

The Rust pipeline is:

```
input bytes ─▶ MIME detection ─▶ pick Extractor ─▶ InternalDocument
            ─▶ derive_extraction_result(output_format) ─▶ ExtractedDocument
                    │
                    └─ renderer (plain / markdown / html / json tree) fills `content`
```

The C# port keeps the same shape. Key concept: **every extractor produces one
intermediate representation — `InternalDocument` — and the output format is a
*rendering* concern applied afterwards.** Extractors never format text themselves
(except when they set `PreRenderedContent`, see below).

### The intermediate representation — `InternalDocument`

Rust: `.reference/crates/xberg/src/types/internal.rs`. This is the spine of the whole system.

- `InternalDocument`
  - `Elements: List<InternalElement>` — flat, in reading order.
  - `Tables: List<Table>`, `Images: List<ExtractedImage>` — referenced by index from elements.
  - `Metadata`, `SourceFormat`, `MimeType`, `Uris`, `Relationships`.
  - `PreRenderedContent: string?` — when an extractor already produced high-quality
    output (e.g. HTML→Markdown), the pipeline returns it verbatim instead of
    re-rendering from elements.
  - `PrebuiltPages`, `Children` (archives), warnings, annotations, form fields, etc.

- `InternalElement`
  - `Kind: ElementKind`, `Text: string`, `Depth: ushort`, `Page: uint?`,
    `Bbox`, `Layer` (Body/Header/Footer/Footnote), `Annotations`, `Attributes`, `Anchor`.
  - OCR-only fields are omitted in the port.

- `ElementKind` (discriminated union — model as a C# abstract record hierarchy or a
  struct with a tag enum + payload). Full variant list:
  `Title`, `Heading{level:byte}`, `Paragraph`, `ListItem{ordered:bool}`, `Code`,
  `Formula`, `FootnoteDefinition`, `FootnoteRef`, `Citation`, `Slide{number:uint}`,
  `DefinitionTerm`, `DefinitionDescription`, `Admonition`, `RawBlock`, `MetadataBlock`,
  `ListStart{ordered:bool}`, `ListEnd`, `QuoteStart`, `QuoteEnd`, `GroupStart`,
  `GroupEnd`, `Table{tableIndex:uint}`, `Image{imageIndex:uint}`, `PageBreak`,
  `OcrText{level}` (emitted only by the port's own optional OCR pass — see
  [Deviation: optional OCR](#deviation-optional-ocr) — never by an extractor).

  Each variant has a stable string `Discriminant()` (see Rust `discriminant()`), used
  for the deterministic element ID.

- `InternalElementId` — `"ie-" + 12 hex chars`, first 6 bytes of a **BLAKE3** hash of
  `(discriminant, text, page.unwrap_or(u32::MAX) LE, index LE)`. Port BLAKE3 (see
  Dependencies). IDs must match byte-for-byte for golden comparison of the structured model.

### The public result — `ExtractedDocument`

Rust: `.reference/crates/xberg/src/types/extraction.rs`. This is the public output type. Fields we
keep: `Content`, `MimeType`, `Metadata`, `ExtractionMethod` (Native/Ocr/Mixed — `Native`
in the port unless the optional OCR pass contributed, which makes it `Mixed`), `Tables`, `DetectedLanguages`, `Images`, `Pages`, `Elements`
(element-based format), `DjotContent`, `Document` (DocumentStructure tree), `Uris`,
`Revisions`, `Annotations`, `Children`, `ProcessingWarnings`. Drop: chunks, embeddings,
ocr_elements, keywords, quality_score, llm_usage.

`ExtractionResult` is the batch envelope: `Results: List<ExtractedDocument>` + errors.

### Renderers

Rust: `.reference/crates/xberg/src/rendering/`. One function per output format, all consuming
`InternalDocument`:

| Format | Rust file | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Plain | `plain.rs` | Concatenate element text, no formatting. |
| Markdown | `markdown.rs` (+ `comrak_bridge.rs`) | GFM. Rust renders an AST via comrak. |
| HTML | `html.rs`, `html_styled.rs` | HTML5. |
| Djot | `djot.rs` | Djot markup. |
| JSON tree | `json.rs` | Heading-driven section tree (`JsonDocument`/`JsonNode`). Port verbatim — it is simple and self-contained. |

`common.rs` holds shared walking state (container nesting, `is_body_element`,
`is_container_end`, `get_language`, `handle_container_end`) — port it first; all
renderers depend on it.

### Config

Rust: `.reference/crates/xberg/src/core/config/`. Port a trimmed `ExtractionConfig` with the fields
content extraction actually reads: `OutputFormat`, format-specific options (PDF, HTML,
Excel, email), `IncludeDocumentStructure`, image-extraction toggles, `ResultFormat`
(Unified vs ElementBased). Drop the embedding/chunking/LLM config sections. `Ocr` is
**not** upstream's OCR config — it is the port's own `OcrOptions`, see
[Deviation: optional OCR](#deviation-optional-ocr).

`OutputFormat`: `Plain` (default), `Markdown`, `Djot`, `Html`, `Json`, `Structured`,
`Custom(name)`.

### MIME detection & format registry

Rust: `.reference/crates/xberg/src/core/mime.rs`, `core/formats.rs`. Maps extension + magic bytes to
a canonical MIME type, which selects the extractor. Port the detection table and magic-byte
sniffing. Each extractor advertises the MIME types / extensions it handles; a registry
dispatches by MIME.

### Extraction pipeline

Rust: `core/pipeline/` + `extraction/derive.rs` (the `InternalDocument → ExtractedDocument`
derivation, ~1600 lines — includes page splitting, structure derivation, language detection).
Port the native-only path. `derive.rs` is large; port incrementally, guided by golden diffs.

## Dependency mapping (Rust crate ➜ C#)

| Rust crate | Purpose | C# replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `image` | Image decode/encode/resize | **SixLabors.ImageSharp** |
| (font metrics, PDF glyphs) | Font parsing | **SixLabors.Fonts** |
| `blake3` | Element IDs | Port BLAKE3 (small) or a vetted C# BLAKE3 package; must match bytes. |
| `serde`/`serde_json` | (De)serialization | `System.Text.Json` with custom converters for the tagged enums. |
| `zip` | OOXML/ODF/EPUB/iWork containers | `System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive`. |
| `quick-xml` / `roxmltree` | XML parsing | `System.Xml` (`XmlReader`/`XDocument`). |
| `calamine` | XLS/XLSX/ODS | Port reader logic on top of ZipArchive + XML (xlsx) and CFB (xls). |
| `cfb` | OLE compound files (doc/ppt/xls/hwp/msg) | Port a small CFB reader (no good maintained NuGet; ~500 lines). |
| `pdf_oxide` / `lopdf` | PDF | Largest effort. Port the reader or evaluate a permissive managed PDF lib; must be pure-managed. |
| `mail-parser` | EML/MSG | Port MIME parsing; `System.Net.Mail` is insufficient. |
| `html-to-markdown-rs` | HTML→Markdown | Port; or AngleSharp for parsing + custom MD writer. |
| `roxmltree`/`org`/`biblatex`/`biblib`/`dbase`/`unhwp`/`sevenz-rust2`/`tar`/`flate2` | misc | Port or find managed equivalents (see TODO per-format). |

> **Rule:** if a Rust crate dependency has no suitable managed C# equivalent, port it
> (into `dotnet/src/XRay.Content/Internal/<name>/`). Prefer BCL types where they are faithful.

```

**`.reference/` is not part of this package** and is never built, published or edited. Keeping
it identical to upstream is what makes an upstream sync a mechanical replay; a local edit there
turns the next sync into a conflict. If one is unavoidable, record it in
`.reference/UPSTREAM.md`.

### `X-Ray` — the family's root package

`dotnet/src/XRay/` is the **umbrella (metapackage) for the X-Ray family**, published as
`X-Ray`. It deliberately contains **no code**: installing it pulls in every X-Ray package, so a
consumer who wants the whole family writes one line instead of tracking the list as it grows.
Every member stays independently installable, and taking one directly loses nothing.

How it works, and what that means for anyone touching it:

- **Members are `ProjectReference`s, not `PackageReference`s.** `dotnet pack` turns a
  ProjectReference to a packable project into a package dependency in the produced nuspec, at
  the version the referenced project was packed with. So publishing the family from one
  pipeline run pins the umbrella's dependencies to that run — there is no version to bump by
  hand and no way for the list to drift out of date.
- **Adding a family member is one line** in `dotnet/src/XRay/XRay.csproj` (plus the pack list
  in `.devops/build-x-ray-nuget.yml`, and a row in both READMEs). Do not add a member as a
  `PackageReference`: that pins a published version and defeats the point above.
- **It ships no assembly.** `IncludeBuildOutput=false` drops the empty `XRay.dll`, and
  `NU5128` — NuGet's warning for a package declaring dependencies without a matching `lib/` —
  is suppressed because that is precisely what a metapackage is. `SuppressDependenciesWhenPacking`
  must stay `false`: the dependencies *are* the payload.
- **The whole family publishes together.** `.devops/build-x-ray-nuget.yml` restores, builds and
  packs both projects in one run at one CalVer version. Publishing a member on its own would
  leave the umbrella pointing at the previous version.
- **Its licence expression covers what it installs**, not what it contains — it contains
  nothing. `MIT AND Apache-2.0`, matching `X-Ray.Content`.

**`README.md` is hand-maintained.** It used to be generated by alef from what is now
`.reference/templates/readme/root.md`, driven by `.reference/alef.toml`. That config is pristine
upstream and still declares a root README target — but it now lives inside `.reference/`, so
running alef there writes `.reference/README.md` and cannot reach this one. Do not copy that
config back to the repository root, and do not run a README generator here.

---

## Testing & validation strategy

1. **Golden reference generation (Rust):** `dotnet/tools/xberg-reference-gen` walks
   `test_documents`, runs the *original* Rust extractors in each output format, and
   writes `{filename}-results-rust.json` next to each fixture. The goldens are **generated
   locally, not committed** — `test_documents` is upstream's repo, and the goldens must be
   re-derived from whatever Rust revision you are syncing against anyway. Regenerate them
   whenever `.reference/crates/xberg` or the submodule pin moves. Format:

   ```json
   {
     "file": "docx/sample.docx",
     "mime_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
     "success": true,
     "extraction_method": "native",
     "metadata": { ... },
     "tables": [ ... ],
     "detected_languages": ["en"],
     "content": { "plain": "...", "markdown": "...", "html": "...", "json": "..." }
   }
   ```

2. **C# test CLI (`XRay.Content.TestRunner`):** runs the C# extractor over the same fixtures and
   diffs against the golden JSON. Reports per-format match / mismatch and a summary. This is
   the primary parity signal — a format is "done" when its fixtures match (allowing for
   documented, intentional differences).

3. **Unit tests (`XRay.Content.Tests`):** port the Rust `#[cfg(test)]` cases (renderers have rich
   ones) as xUnit tests for fast, isolated feedback.

Exact byte-for-byte parity is the goal for plain/json; Markdown/HTML may differ in
whitespace where the Rust path uses comrak — document any deliberate normalization.

## Re-syncing after an upstream sync

The Rust tree under `.reference/` is deliberately left byte-identical to upstream, so pulling
upstream in is mechanical and the whole job is re-deriving the C# port's behaviour.

**Getting upstream in is its own procedure**, because upstream's files live under `.reference/`
here and its commits are written against the repository root. A `git merge` cannot bridge that;
the commits are replayed with `git am --directory=.reference` instead. That is a skill:
[`.claude/skills/sync-upstream-reference`](.claude/skills/sync-upstream-reference/SKILL.md), and
`.reference/UPSTREAM.md` records the last upstream commit replayed. Everything below is what
happens *after* the tree is up to date.

The loop that works:

1. **Sync upstream, then materialize the corpus.** The `test_documents` submodule is
   LFS-free: text fixtures are in git, but every binary (office, PDF, epub, images) lives
   in a public bucket listed in `corpus.lock.json`. Fetch them first, or the office and
   PDF fixtures silently do not exist:

   ```sh
   git submodule update --init --depth 1 test_documents
   python3 test_documents/scripts/fetch_corpus.py     # ~580 MiB, re-runnable
   ```

2. **Regenerate the goldens against the merged Rust.** This is the whole point — the
   goldens encode current upstream behaviour, so the diff against them *is* the list of
   upstream changes that still need porting:

   ```sh
   cargo build --release --manifest-path dotnet/tools/xberg-reference-gen/Cargo.toml
   dotnet/tools/xberg-reference-gen/target/release/xberg-reference-gen test_documents
   ```

   It skips fixtures that already have a golden, so pass `--overwrite` after a Rust bump.

3. **Measure, then triage by cluster, not by fixture.** `--cluster` groups plain-text
   mismatches by the text at their first divergence, which turns "410 markdown fixtures
   fail" into "395 of them diverge at the same smart-quote character":

   ```sh
   dotnet run --project dotnet/tools/XRay.Content.TestRunner -c Release -- test_documents --ext md --cluster
   dotnet run --project dotnet/tools/XRay.Content.TestRunner -c Release -- test_documents --ext docx --diff --show 3
   dotnet run --project dotnet/tools/XRay.Content.TestRunner -c Release -- --dump-metadata test_documents/x.pdf
   ```

4. **Fix against the Rust source, not against the golden.** Read the current Rust for the
   behaviour, port it, then confirm the numbers move. A golden tells you *that* something
   differs; only the Rust tells you what the rule is.

5. **Expect unit tests to fail where upstream changed behaviour.** A red test that pins
   the old behaviour is the correct outcome — update it to the new rule and say so in the
   commit, rather than working around it.

---

## Porting order (see `dotnet/TODO.md` for the full checklist)

1. **Core spine:** types, renderers, config, MIME, registry, minimal pipeline. Validate with
   text/markdown/csv/json fixtures (no heavy deps).
2. **Office (priority):** docx, xlsx, pptx, odt, doc, ppt, rtf, epub.
3. **Structured & markup:** html, xml, json/yaml/toml, csv, ods, jats, docbook, opml.
4. **Email & archives:** eml, msg, pst; zip, tar, 7z, gzip.
5. **Remaining:** pdf, images (metadata/exif only; pixels are read only by the opt-in
   OCR pass), hwp/hwpx, iwork, latex, rst,
   org, typst, bibtex, fictionbook, jupyter, dbf, mdx.
6. **Code files (lowest priority):** tree-sitter equivalent — only after everything above
   is ported and green.

## Conventions

- Match Rust field/variant names in the serialized JSON (snake_case) via
  `JsonSerializerOptions` / `[JsonPropertyName]` so golden diffs are meaningful.
- Keep extractor logic close to the Rust source; cite the Rust file at the top of each C#
  extractor so re-syncing after upstream changes is mechanical.
- No `unsafe`, no P/Invoke to native libs — pure managed so the NuGet package is portable.
  This is why layout detection ships as a hand-written ONNX runtime (`Internal/Onnx`)
  rather than a binding to ONNX Runtime: the Rust build links `ort` natively, which a
  portable package cannot. See `dotnet/tools/onnx-parity/README.md` for how that runtime is
  validated against ONNX Runtime layer by layer.
  The optional OCR pass is the single documented exception — it pulls native code in
  transitively, which is why it is off by default. See
  [Deviation: optional OCR](#deviation-optional-ocr).

---

## Deviation: formatted Excel cells

Small, and unlike OCR it changes a default rather than adding an opt-in pass, so it is worth
knowing about before a golden diff is read as a regression.

**What upstream does.** calamine hands the Rust side a bare `f64` and `format_cell_to_string`
prints it, so a cell displaying `3.2%` reaches a golden as `0.032280358222708555`, one
displaying `$31,200` as `31200`, and a date as its serial number. The number format the
workbook carries is never consulted.

**What the port does.** `XRayOptions.ExcelNumberFormats`, **on by default**, renders a numeric
cell through its own format code, so an extracted cell reads the way the spreadsheet shows it.
Set it false — or `XRAY_EXCEL_NUMBER_FORMATS=0` for a harness — to get upstream's rendering
back, which is what a run against the Rust goldens needs.

**How it is put together.** One renderer, `Internal/Excel/ExcelNumberFormat`, holds the whole
grammar; `ExcelCellFormats` is the two-level lookup (number formats, and the cell formats that
cite them) each container fills from its own records:

| Container | Where the formats are | Which cell formats count |
|---|---|---|
| `.xls` | BIFF `FORMAT` (0x041E) and `XF` (0x00E0) records in the globals substream | all of them — a cell's `ixfe` indexes one combined list |
| `.xlsx` | `xl/styles.xml`, `numFmts` and `cellXfs` | `cellXfs`, indexed by a cell's `s` attribute |
| `.xlsb` | `xl/styles.bin`, `BrtFmt` and `BrtXF` | only the `BrtXF`s inside the `cellXfs` block, since `cellStyleXfs` shares the record id |

Nothing else in the extraction flow changes: cells are still strings on a grid, and every
renderer downstream is untouched.

**Two deliberate departures from what Excel draws.** `_x` reserves the width of a character and
`* x` fills the cell with one; both are alignment, not content, so neither is emitted — the
accounting format `_("$"* #,##0_)` yields `$31,200` where Excel draws `$␣␣31,200␣`. And a
format the renderer has no shape for — a fraction, scientific notation, elapsed time — falls
back to the unformatted value rather than to a guess, so an unusual workbook degrades to
today's output.

**What it does not touch.** A `General` cell, which is most of the corpus: of the Excel
fixtures, only `xls/test_excel.xls` moves.

**ODS is deliberately left out**, and stays at upstream parity. Its numeric cells reach
`OdsExtractor` as `office:value` and are printed the same way calamine prints them, so a
percentage there is still a ratio. Bringing it along is a separate change and a smaller one:
an ODS cell already carries its displayed text in the `<text:p>` the extractor reads only for
string cells, so it needs no format grammar at all — OpenDocument's `number:` style elements
are a different language from Excel's format codes, and nothing above would be reused.

---

## Deviation: optional OCR

This is the port's **largest intentional divergence from upstream `xberg`**. Everything else
in this repository aims at parity; this does not. It is recorded here because a future
re-sync will otherwise read it as drift and try to "fix" it.

### What changed, and why it is a deviation

The charter above excluded OCR outright. It is now available as an **opt-in extraction
pass**, `XRay.Content.Core.Ocr`, driven by `ExtractionConfig.Ocr`. Three things make this a
deviation rather than a port:

1. **Different engine family.** Upstream reaches for Tesseract, or candle-hosted VLMs
   through `ort`. The port uses [PaddleOCR-VL](https://github.com/theolivenbaum/PaddleOCR/)
   (`PaddleOCR` on NuGet, `PaddleOcrSharp` assembly). Two OCR engines never agree
   character-for-character, so **no golden fixture can compare OCR output across the two
   implementations.** Do not write one. The tests guard the *flow* — gating, placement,
   budgets, failure handling — not the recognition.
2. **It breaks the "pure managed" convention.** `PaddleOCR` brings SkiaSharp for image
   decoding, and `PaddleOCR.Pdf` brings PDFium (via `PDFtoImage`) for page rasterisation.
   Both are native. This is exactly what the Conventions section forbids, and the reason
   the feature is **off by default**: a consumer that never sets `Ocr` never loads either.
   PDFium is not optional-in-principle — the port's PDF reader extracts text and geometry
   but does not rasterise, and a scanned page's text exists *only* as pixels, so `ScanOnly`
   could not work at all without a rasteriser.
3. **Upstream's config shape is not mirrored.** `OcrOptions` is designed for this pass, not
   ported from `.reference/crates/xberg/src/core/config/`. Do not try to reconcile the two.

### The three modes

`OcrOptions.Mode`, default `Disabled`:

| Mode | What it recognises |
|---|---|
| `Disabled` | Nothing. No model is resolved, no native library is touched. |
| `ScanOnly` | Pages a PDF's scan detector flagged (`PdfMetadata.ScannedPages`, from the existing `PdfScanDetect`). The pages are rasterised at `Dpi` and recognised whole; the text is **appended** as a page-level `OcrText` element carrying its `Page`, because a whole page's recognition has no single element to sit after. |
| `AllImages` | Every embedded image that carries bytes and clears `MinImagePixels`, plus the `ScanOnly` behaviour for PDFs. Each image's text is **inserted immediately after the `Image` element that references it**, so every renderer places it inline for free. An image no element references is appended rather than dropped. Selecting it makes `ExtractionConfig.NeedsImageData()` true, which is what gets a standalone image file's bytes attached for the pass to find — see below. |

### Tables come back as tables, not as markup

PaddleOCR-VL reads a table region as OTSL and its pipeline converts that to an HTML
`<table>` (`OtslTable.ToHtml`), so a recognition arrives as text with HTML tables embedded in
it. Dropping that into a text element would make every output format wrong in its own way —
Markdown emitting raw HTML where a pipe table belongs, plain text emitting the tags
themselves.

`OcrTables.Split` therefore cuts a recognition into its text runs and its tables before any of
it becomes an element, and each table is pushed onto `InternalDocument.Tables` behind an
ordinary `Table` element. From there nothing about it is OCR-specific: Markdown writes a pipe
table, HTML writes a real `<table>`, plain text writes the cells, and the table shows up in
`ExtractedDocument.Tables` where a consumer already looks for one.

Two decisions inside it are worth keeping:

- **Cells hold plain text, not rendered Markdown.** The HTML extractor renders its cells as
  Markdown, because a cell there can contain real inline markup. An OCR cell cannot —
  `OtslTable` encodes the recognised text — so rendering it would only escape characters the
  camera saw, and the same grid is what the plain and HTML renderers read. Entities are
  decoded, whitespace collapsed, nothing escaped; the Markdown renderer escapes what Markdown
  needs, once, on the way out.
- **Placement is the shared `GridFlatten` rule**, so a merged cell keeps the rest of its row
  lined up with its headers exactly as it would in any other format.

A `<table>` that yields no grid — unbalanced markup, or nothing but empty cells — stays in the
text verbatim. Markup a consumer can still parse beats a table invented from a failed read.

### Where it runs, and why there

`OcrProcessor.Process` runs in `Extractor` **between extraction and
`Derive.DeriveExtractionResult`** — on the element stream, not the rendered string:

```
extractor.Extract(…) ─▶ InternalDocument ─▶ OcrProcessor.Process ─▶ Derive… ─▶ ExtractedDocument
```

That ordering is what makes "inline" literal. A pass over rendered text could only append.
Note this differs from `QrPostProcessor`, which runs after rendering.

### Invariants worth not breaking

- **Additive only.** Native text is never replaced. A page that already has text keeps it.
- **Never fatal.** A missing checkpoint, an undecodable image, or a recognition that
  outruns `PerImageTimeout` becomes a `ProcessingWarning` with source `"ocr"`; the document
  comes back intact. A document is not a failure for lacking OCR.
- **No work, no weights.** What there is to recognise is computed before the engine is
  constructed, so a mode with nothing to do costs nothing.
- **The pass walks `InternalDocument.Images`, so something has to put them there.** Upstream
  recognises a standalone image *inside* its image extractor, so its bytes never have to travel;
  here the two are separate, and `ImageExtractor` follows upstream's
  `build_image_internal_document(None, attach_image)` — bytes only when
  `config.needs_image_data()`. `ExtractionConfig.NeedsImageData()` is that predicate:
  `ExtractImages || QrCodes == true || Ocr.Mode == AllImages`. Drop the OCR term and `AllImages`
  goes quiet on every plain `.png` — no warning, no error, just no text, which is exactly how it
  behaved before this was noticed. `ScanOnly` is deliberately not a term: it rasterises pages from
  the original PDF bytes and never reads the image collection.
- **`ExtractImages` is off by default and that is not an oversight.** The bytes of a standalone
  image are the whole input file, so attaching them unconditionally would put every image
  extraction's input into its own output. Upstream defaults the same way — its `images` is an
  `Option` whose `None` means no image extraction. The extractors that already attach
  unconditionally (docx, rtf, epub, hwp, odf) are left alone: upstream gates them on the same
  flag, but retrofitting it here would *remove* images that callers already receive.
- **Nothing downloads.** `OcrOptions.ModelDirectory` (and `LayoutModelDirectory`) name where
  the checkpoint already is; absent those, PaddleOCR's own cache root is consulted so a
  cache warmed out of band works unconfigured. A missing checkpoint raises
  `OcrUnavailableException` — the pass will not pull gigabytes as a side effect of an
  extraction call.
- **A recognised table is a table.** It goes into `InternalDocument.Tables` behind a `Table`
  element rather than staying HTML in a text element, so the output format decides how it is
  written. See [Tables come back as tables](#tables-come-back-as-tables-not-as-markup).
- **`ExtractionMethod` becomes `Mixed`, not `Ocr`**, when the pass contributes. The native
  text is still there, and a consumer treating the whole document as machine-read would be
  wrong about most of it.

### Testing

`IOcrEngine` exists so the flow is testable: the shipped recognizer needs a multi-gigabyte
checkpoint, so `OcrProcessorTests` drives everything through a fake. Recognition quality is
PaddleOCR's own business and is not re-tested here. Every assertion in that file has been
mutation-proved — each behaviour above was reverted in turn and the corresponding test watched
to fail.

Most of that file builds an `InternalDocument` by hand, which is the right shape for testing
placement and budgets and the wrong one for testing whether a document *arrives* with images:
a hand-built document has whatever images the test gave it, which is precisely what was broken.
`AllImagesRecognisesAStandaloneImageFile` therefore runs the real `ImageExtractor` and then the
pass. Keep that one end to end.

### The PaddleOCR packages are binary-fragile — bump both, and rebuild

`PdfRasterizer.Render` gained an optional `maxPagePixels` parameter in `PaddleOCR.Pdf`
26.9.5064. Adding an optional parameter is source-compatible and **not** binary-compatible: an
`X-Ray.Content` compiled against 26.8.4668 calls a four-argument overload that no longer exists,
so a consumer whose graph resolves the newer package gets a `MissingMethodException` the moment
`ScanOnly` rasterises. The never-fatal rule then turns it into a processing warning, so the
symptom is a scanned PDF that quietly reads empty and an OCR pass that looks much *faster*.
Keep `PaddleOCR` and `PaddleOCR.Pdf` on the same version, and publish a rebuilt package when
they move.
